# JLibSys
Java Library Management System using OOP Concepts

ðŸ“– Overview

JLibSys is a mini Library Management System built in Java demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
It allows managing books and users, issuing and returning books, and viewing available books efficiently.

ðŸš€ Features

Add books to the library
Add users to the system
Issue books to users (prevents double-issuing)
Return books
Display all available books
Keep track of issued books per user

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

Java 17+
VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA
Terminal / Command Prompt

ðŸ“Œ Concepts Implemented

Abstraction â€“ User and Book classes hide internal implementation details
Encapsulation â€“ Private fields with getters/setters
Inheritance â€“ Can extend User class for specialized users
Polymorphism â€“ Overridden toString() methods
Constructor Chaining â€“ Using this() and super()
Dynamic Binding â€“ Runtime method overriding
